<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I am Nirmal Subedi, a student for CIS 162. I am currently attending Cerritos College.   <br>
   Before I entered Postsecondary Education, I was doing my Secondary Education at         <br>
   Norwalk High School. I graduated the school not too long ago and was nervously prepping <br>
   for college. Even though it was nerve-racking for me on the first day, I eventually     <br>
   got used to it, and long before the feeling of nervousness changed into calmness, as I  <br>
   saw myself succeeding in my classes.</p>

<h1>When I have free time</h1>
<ol>
    <li>I like listening to music.</li>
    <li>Surfing the internet.</li>
    <li>Drawing whenever I have something to draw on.</li>
</ol>

<p>My favorite website is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</a> because there are a lot of educational and entertaining videos.</p>
