<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I am Nirmal Subedi, a student for CIS 162. I am currently attending Cerritos College.   
   Before I entered Postsecondary Education, I was doing my Secondary Education at         
   Norwalk High School. I graduated the school not too long ago and was nervously prepping 
   for college. Even though it was nerve-racking for me on the first day, I eventually     
   got used to it, and long before the feeling of nervousness changed into calmness, as I  
   saw myself succeeding in my classes.</p>
