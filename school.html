    <h2>Cerritos College</h2>
        <p>I am currently, studying at <a href="https://www.cerritos.edu/">Cerritos College!</a>
            By taking online classes. The reasons that I chose to do this has the 
            the flexibility of time and comfort. I like the flexibility of time part of being in 
            an online class because I do not have to worry so much so about having been on at a 
            the certain time when I might have other things planned or some unexpected event
            disrupts my plans and now I cannot show up on time therefore, I miss out on learning.
            Additionally, I like the comfort of being at home because I do not have to worry about 
            transporting to and from school, what to eat, and whether the seats are comfortable.
